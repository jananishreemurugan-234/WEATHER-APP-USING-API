# WEATHER-APP-USING-API

## Project Overview

This project is part of the RISE Internship Python Programming Projects series. The Weather App is a beginner-friendly Python application that demonstrates the integration of APIs with a Graphical User Interface (GUI). It fetches real-time weather information from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays it in a simple Tkinter window.

Users often need quick access to weather details like temperature, humidity, and conditions. Instead of searching online, this app provides a convenient way to check the weather by entering the city name. The app is lightweight, runs locally, and is an excellent learning project for Python beginners who want to explore API usage and GUI development.


## Objectives

Provide real-time weather updates for any city.

Build a Tkinter-based GUI to make it user-friendly.

Learn how to integrate an external API (OpenWeatherMap).

Display important weather parameters such as:

### Temperature (°C)
### Humidity (%)
### Weather Description


## Requirements

To run this project, you need:

Python 3.13.6 installed on your system.

Tkinter (comes pre-installed with Python).

Requests library for API calls. Install it with:

pip install requests

A free API key from OpenWeatherMap.


## Step-by-Step Usage

1. Clone or Download the repository.


2. Install dependencies (if not already installed).


3. Replace "your_api_key_here" in the code with your own OpenWeatherMap API key.


4. Run the script:

python weather_app.py


5. Enter a city name in the input box and click Get Weather.


6. The app will display:

Temperature in Celsius

Humidity percentage

Weather condition (e.g., Clear, Rainy, Cloudy)


## GUI Preview (Conceptual)

A Tkinter window titled “Weather App”.

Input box where the user types the city name.

Button: Get Weather.

Labels displaying temperature, humidity, and description.


## Features

Real-time weather updates

Simple and clean interface

Error handling for invalid city names

Beginner-friendly Python project

(Optional) Weather icons for visual effect


## Learning Outcomes

By completing this project, you will learn:

How to fetch data from an API using Python.

How to build a Tkinter GUI application.

How to handle JSON responses.

How to manage errors (e.g., wrong city input, no internet).


## Conclusion

The Weather App Using API is a simple yet powerful Python project that demonstrates the practical use of APIs in real-world applications. By combining Tkinter for GUI and OpenWeatherMap API for live data, the project provides a smooth user experience where anyone can check weather details instantly.

This project helps beginners understand how to:

Work with APIs and JSON responses.

Build interactive applications using Tkinter.

Handle errors gracefully in real-time applications.


Overall, this Weather App is not just an academic exercise but also a stepping stone toward creating more advanced data-driven applications. It strengthens both Python programming skills and problem-solving abilities, making it a valuable addition to any beginner’s project portfolio.
